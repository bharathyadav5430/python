Module 5:
1. Using print() for Output
The print() function displays information to the user. You can use it to show strings, numbers, or even complex expressions. It’s like Python’s way of “talking” to users.
Syntax:
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n')
•	value1, value2, etc.: The values to be printed. Multiple items can be printed by separating them with commas.
•	sep: Defines the separator between multiple values. Default is a space (' ').
•	end: Specifies what is printed at the end of the line. Default is a newline ('\n'), but you can change it.
Examples:
print("Hello, world!")                     # Output: Hello, world!
print("My age is", 20)                     # Output: My age is 20
print("Python", "is", "fun", sep="-")      # Output: Python-is-fun
print("Stay positive!", end=" :)")         # Output: Stay positive! :)

In the above examples:
•	sep changes the separator from space to a dash -.
•	end replaces the default newline with a smiley face, keeping everything on one line.

2. Using input() for Input
The input() function allows us to receive input from the user. When input() is called, the program waits until the user types something and presses Enter.
Syntax:
variable = input(prompt)
•	prompt: A message displayed to the user before waiting for their input (e.g., "Enter your name: ").
•	Important: input() always returns the user input as a string.
Examples:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)

age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are", age, "years old.")
Explanation:
•	Here, input("What is your name? ") displays a prompt and stores the input in name.
•	input("How old are you? ") does the same but stores the age. Notice that age will be a string, even if the user enters a number.

3. Converting Input to Other Data Types
Since input() returns a string, we often need to convert this input to other types, like integers or floats.
Examples:
# Convert input to an integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))         # User enters 20
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1)

# Convert input to a float
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))  # User enters 1.75
print("Your height is", height, "meters.")
Explanation:
•	int(input("Enter your age: ")) converts the input to an integer. If the user enters 20, it’s stored as 20 (an integer).
•	float(input("Enter your height: ")) converts input to a float, useful for values with decimal points.
